Framework vs Library in Node.js:
A library is a collection of code that provides reusable functionality that can be called by an application. It doesn't dictate the overall structure or architecture of the application.
A framework is a pre-built structure that provides a foundation for an application. It includes a set of rules and guidelines that developers must follow, and provides a way to organize code and achieve common tasks quickly.

Middleware:
Middleware in Node.js is a function that sits in between the initial client request and the final server response. It can modify the request or response object, perform additional operations, or pass control to the next middleware in the chain.

JSON Payload:
JSON Payload is a format used to send data between a client and a server. It stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it is a lightweight and human-readable format that can be easily parsed and generated by most programming languages.

Parse:
Parse in Node.js refers to the process of taking a string of data and converting it into a structured format that can be used by the application. This is commonly used with data formats such as JSON, XML, and CSV.

Mongoose Schema:
A Mongoose Schema is a blueprint for defining the structure of a MongoDB document. It defines the properties and data types of each field in the document.

Mongoose Model:
A Mongoose Model is a class that represents a collection in MongoDB. It is created from a Schema and provides an interface for interacting with the database.

Route:
A Route in Node.js refers to the mapping between an HTTP request and the code that will handle the request. Routes are used to define the behavior of an application when a client sends an HTTP request.

POST Request:
A POST Request is an HTTP method used to send data to a server to create or update a resource. It is commonly used in web applications for user registration, form submission, and other data entry tasks.

Axios:
Axios is a popular library for making HTTP requests from JavaScript applications. It provides a simple and consistent API for making HTTP requests and handling responses.

API Endpoint:
An API Endpoint is the URL that a client sends HTTP requests to in order to interact with a server's API. It is the specific location where the API request should be sent.

Environment Variable:
An Environment Variable is a value that is set outside of the application code and is accessible from within the application. It is typically used to store configuration information or sensitive data that should not be hard-coded into the application. Environment variables are set on the system or environment where the application is running, and can be accessed using the process.env object in Node.js.
